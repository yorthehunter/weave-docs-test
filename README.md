## How Do I Apply Weave to my UI Problem)?
### Step 1
Read the [Weave documentation](https://github.com/stitchfix/weave-styleguide): Is my problem solved by Weave?

### Step 2
- If **YES**, then use the code provided in the documentation.
- If **NO**, then consult your closest UX representative for advice on how to proceed.

### Step 3
If your problem is **only** solved by UI that doesn't currently exist in the Weave design system, work with UX on the possibility to add your UI feature into the code base.
